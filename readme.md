- Task Management API with Authentication, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Real-Time Updates
- Features:

1. User Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   Users can have roles like "admin", "user", or "manager".
   Admins can manage users and tasks.
   Regular users can manage their own tasks.
3. Task Management:
   CRUD operations for tasks: create, read, update, and delete.
4. Real-Time Updates using WebSockets (Socket.io) for task updates.
5. Database Integratio using PostgreSQL and sequelize.
6. Caching with Redis to improve performance for frequently accessed tasks.
7. Rate Limiting to prevent abuse.

- Technologies Involved:
  Express.js for building the API.
  JWT for authentication.
  Sequelize for PostgreSQL respectively.
  Socket.io for real-time task updates.
  Redis for caching.
  Helmet and Rate-limiting for security and request control.

2. **Architecture Overview:**

Node.js with Express.js: We'll use Express to handle API requests.
Sequelize ORM: For database management and queries with PostgreSQL.
Database (PostgreSQL):

1. Users Table (for PostgreSQL using Sequelize):
   id (Primary Key, UUID)
   username (String, unique)
   email (String, unique)
   password (String, hashed)
   createdAt (Date)
   updatedAt (Date)
2. Roles Table (for PostgreSQL using Sequelize):
   id (Primary Key, UUID)
   roleName (String, unique)
   createdAt (Date)
   updatedAt (Date)

3. UserRoles Table (Join Table for Users and Roles):
   id (Primary Key, UUID)
   userId (Foreign Key, references Users table)
   roleId (Foreign Key, references Roles table)
   createdAt (Date)
   updatedAt (Date)

4. Tasks Table:

Fields: id, title, description, completed, userId, createdAt, updatedAt.
Purpose: Stores tasks with reference to the owner (userId).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

The role field in the Users table defines user roles.
Admins have the ability to manage tasks and users, while regular users can manage only their tasks.
Authentication and Authorization:
JWT (JSON Web Token):
Used for authentication. Upon login, the server generates a JWT token for the user.
This token is required to access protected routes like task management.
Authorization Middleware:
Middleware will check the token and validate user roles for protected routes.
Request-Response Flow:
User Registration and Login:

The user registers or logs in, and upon successful login, receives a JWT token.
The JWT token is stored on the client-side and passed with each request for authentication.
Task Operations (CRUD):

The user sends a request to create, view, update, or delete a task.
The API checks the userâ€™s JWT token and retrieves the associated user information.
Tasks are managed with reference to the userId field in the Tasks table to ensure users can only manage their tasks.

3. Routes and API Endpoints:

User Routes:
POST /register: Register a new user.
POST /login: User login, returns JWT.
GET /profile: Get user profile information.
Task Routes:
POST /tasks: Create a new task.
GET /tasks: Get all tasks for the logged-in user.
PATCH /tasks/
: Update a task by ID (only if the task belongs to the logged-in user).
DELETE /tasks/
: Delete a task by ID (only if the task belongs to the logged-in user).
Admin Routes (RBAC-based, restricted to admin users):
GET /users: Get all users (admin only).
DELETE /users/
: Delete a user by ID (admin only).

5. Middleware:
   Authentication Middleware:
   Validates the JWT token provided by the user.
   Decodes the token to get user details and verify authenticity.
   Attaches user info to the req object if valid, otherwise denies access.
   Role-Based Access Control Middleware:
   Checks if the user has the required role (e.g., admin).
   Prevents unauthorized users from accessing certain endpoints (e.g., user management).
   Error Handling Middleware:
   Centralized error handling middleware to ensure consistent error responses for invalid requests.

6. Task Workflow Example:
   Creating a Task:
   Client: Sends a POST request to /tasks with the task details in the request body (e.g., title, description).
   API: Verifies the user via JWT. If valid, it creates a new task associated with the user (userId).
   Response: Returns the created task as JSON.
   Viewing Tasks:
   Client: Sends a GET request to /tasks with the JWT token.
   API: Verifies the JWT and retrieves tasks associated with the logged-in user (userId).
   Response: Returns the tasks as JSON.

7. Security Considerations:

- JWT Expiry and Refresh Tokens:

Set an expiration time for the JWT (e.g., 1 hour).
Implement a refresh token mechanism for seamless user experience.

- Password Hashing:

Use a strong hashing algorithm like bcrypt to hash passwords before storing them in the database.

- Rate Limiting:

Use express-rate-limit to prevent API abuse (e.g., too many login attempts or task creation requests).

- Helmet.js:

Use Helmet to set secure HTTP headers (e.g., to prevent cross-site scripting attacks).

Step 3: Implement Authentication and RBAC
Goal: Set up user authentication (JWT) and RBAC to ensure only authorized users access certain parts of the API.

1. Authentication Middleware (middleware/authMiddleware.js):
   Responsibility: Verify JWT tokens and attach the authenticated user to the request object.
2. Role Middleware (middleware/roleMiddleware.js):
   Responsibility: Check if the authenticated user has the appropriate role.
   Reasoning:
   Using separate middleware files keeps authentication and role-based logic separate from business logic, adhering to SRP.
   Step 4: Implement Task CRUD Operations
   Goal: Create routes and controllers for task management.

Task Controller (controllers/taskController.js):
Create Task: Handles the creation of a task and associates it with the user.

Get Tasks: Retrieves tasks only for the logged-in user.

Update/Delete Task: Validates ownership before making any changes.

Reasoning: Keeping controller logic separate allows for easier testing and follows the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by not forcing controllers to handle unrelated concerns.

Step 5: Test the API
Goal: Test each API endpoint using Postman or curl to ensure all CRUD operations and authentication work as expected.

Test Scenarios:
User Registration and Login: Verify JWT token is returned.
Task CRUD: Test creating, updating, deleting tasks, and ensure only the task owner can perform these operations.
Role Assignment: Verify only an admin can assign roles.
Step 6: Enhance with Real-Time Features (Optional)
Goal: Use Socket.io to add real-time task status updates.

Architecture:
Whenever a task is created, updated, or deleted, emit an event to connected clients using Socket.io.
Reasoning: Real-time features improve user experience and Socket.io allows event-driven communication, separating concerns from the REST API.
Key Best Practices Applied:
Separation of Concerns: Divided logic across controllers, models, and routes.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each module has one clear responsibility.
Scalable Directory Structure: Organized the project to be modular and easy to extend.
Security: Used bcrypt for hashing, JWT for token-based authentication, and dotenv for secure environment variable management.
Reusability: Used Sequelize hooks for reusable pre-save logic and middleware for reusable auth checks.
